                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>This is a story for the ages. Once when I was in first grade we had to do a play where each student was one of the animals of the rainforest. I drew the role of the Red Eyed Treefrog and my grandmother, the saint that she was, made me a custom Red Eyed Treefrog costume. My grandma was amazing. The end.</p>

                <h3 class="post-title">Why I decided to create a "Frog Blog"</h3>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Well, I think firstly the reason I created this blog is because the word blog rhymes with the word frog. I am very creative. Secondarily, I've always been fascinated by amphibians and I thought that writing about a few transformative experiences related to this group of extraordinary creatures might be an interesting meditative exercise. So, what began as a very silly (and basic) free associative, nonsensical rhyme led to something I actually had an interest in doing. Pretty neat, huh? No? Yeah I know.</p>
